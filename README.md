# 🐍 Snake Game (Pygame Edition)

A simple Snake game built with **Python** and **Pygame**, just for fun.  
I created this project to try myself in 2D game development and experiment with Pygame.

- **Python 3.9**
- `pygame==2.5.2` — game rendering and input handling

git clone https://github.com/your_username/snake-game.git

```

## 🧪 Run Tests
